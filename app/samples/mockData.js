      '1/2 cup bacon grease',
      '3/4 cup unpopped popcorn kernels',
      '1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste',

When the popping slows down, remove the pan from the heat and let it finish popping.\n\nPour the popcorn into a large bowl or paper sack. Season with half of the seasoned salt and stir. Taste before adding more salt if desired. Toss with bacon bits and shredded Cheddar cheese for an extra special treat. Store leftovers in lunch sacks or sandwich bags."
